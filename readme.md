# 📄 School Report Project 🎓👨🏻‍🏫

## 🔧 About the Project

This project is a simple interactive web application designed to generate a student's school report based on user inputs for grades and absences across four periods.

It features:

- Data input validation to ensure accurate entries.
- Calculation of average grades and total absences.
- Status determination (“Failed”, “Recovery”, or “Approved”) based on grades and attendance.
- Responsive UI styled with Tailwind CSS.

## 🔄 How It Works

1. The application requests the student's full name.
2. Users are prompted to enter the grades and absences for each of the four periods.
3. Input validation checks ensure grades fall between 0 and 10 and absences between 0 and 40.
4. The report displays:
   - Grades per period
   - Absences per period
   - Total absences and average grade
   - Final status message, including specific cases like "Failed due to absences" or "Approved with excellence!"
5. Errors are highlighted when invalid data is detected.
